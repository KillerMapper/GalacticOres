# GalacticOres
A small mod made in less a day to add ore to Galaxy Space addon for Galacticraft

This mod doesn't generate ores by itself. It is meant to work with another mod which can do the ore generation, like COFH Core.
Each ore has an associated planet or moon from Galaxy Space (for texture match). 

Check the wiki to understand how to make the ores being generated in Galaxy Space dimensions, using CoFHCore: https://github.com/KillerMapper/GalacticOres/wiki
